The consistent trend is that fixed-length coding is always greater than the Huffman cost. Also, the ratio of huffman vs. fixed-length are fairly similar despite the ranging lengths of the documents.

- **e.**
On a document in which every character had the same frequency with alphabet Sigma all of the frequencies would equal each other so the expected cost would be the frequency times the encodingsâ€™ lengths, i.e., a balanced tree of n leaves * log n = total cost of nlogn for all the documents.
